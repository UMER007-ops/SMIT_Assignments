      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Curiosity is a powerful engine for learning. When we wonder about the world, we <strong>ask questions</strong>, seek new experiences, and build knowledge incrementally. This essay explores why curiosity matters and how it can be nurtured.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Curiosity Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Curiosity drives discovery. <em>Researchers</em> have found that people who maintain curiosity across their lives often have broader knowledge, greater problem-solving skills, and more creative thinking. In short, curiosity helps us to adapt and grow.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." — a reminder to keep exploring.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Ways to Nurture Curiosity</h2>
      <p>Here are a few practical habits that make it easier to stay curious:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask open-ended questions</strong> — begin with "why" and "how" instead of simple yes/no queries.</li>
        <li><strong>Read widely</strong> — short articles, long-form essays, and even fiction widen your perspective.</li>
        <li><strong>Try new things</strong> — small experiments teach faster than passive reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep a learning log</strong> — note what surprised you and what you want to investigate next.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Curiosity in Everyday Life</h2>
      <p>
        Curiosity doesn't need to be grand. It lives in small moments: the choice to take a different route home, to try a recipe, or to follow a stray interest down a rabbit hole. These moments compound over time and create meaningful change.
